# vitest-coverage-report-action

A GitHub Action to report vitest test coverage results.

## Current States

This is a work in progress projects. Currently, it will only take an already created `json-summary`-report, convert it to markdown and export that to:

1. A comment within an associated pull-request (if there is one)
2. Append it to the [GitHub Step Summary]()

Currently work in progress.
