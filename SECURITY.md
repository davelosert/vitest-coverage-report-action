# Security Policy

I am using all of [GitHub's security features](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security) to manage security vulnerabilities in this project as best as I can. But well, we all know that things might slip through.

So I am happy for any vulnerability reports, and I will do my best to fix them as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it by [opening a Draft Security Advisory](https://github.com/davelosert/vitest-coverage-report-action/security/advisories/new) (you can manually navigate to it by clicking on the "Security" tab in the repository, then on "Advisories" and then hit the green Button that says "New draft security advisory").
